# Measure Theory Notes

These are my personal self-study notes on measure theory, primarily based on "**Measures, Integrals and Martingales by René L. Schilling**".

## Topics Covered

- σ-algebras
- Measure spaces
- Uniqueness of Measures
- Existence of Measures

The content in these notes is heavily influenced by the theory and examples presented in Schilling's book.
