# Measure Theory Notes

These are my personal self-study notes on measure theory, primarily based on *Integration, Measure, and Martingales* by Michael J. Steele.

## Topics Covered

- Ïƒ-algebras
- Measure spaces
- Uniqueness of Measures
- Existence of Measures

The content in these notes is heavily influenced by the theory and examples presented in Steele's book.
